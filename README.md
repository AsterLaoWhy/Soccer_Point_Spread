# Point Spread Prediction
Supervised learning model
 Predict soccer match point spread for winning
 Make sure there isn't too much of a distribution disparity between tie/win/and loss
 Clearing columns that are multicoliniar or irrelevant to the analysis (i.e. player name)
 Join the dataframes
 Deal with missing data
 Make sure data distributino is normal
 See how my models perform and check multiple metrics in addition to the graphs (LR, Lasso, Ridge, Elasticnet, GBR)
 SelectKBest to try for best hyperparameters
 Compare with Random forest ensamble and KNN
 Metrics are bad for point split regression
 Look at confusion matrix to see the variance/bias visually
 
 Actionable next steps:
  - Rather than trying to predict point split, predict W/L would probably be better given the closeness of the estimates
  - It seems there is no standout attribute to look out for
